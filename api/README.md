## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v20.x or later)
- [npm](https://npm.io/) (or your preferred package manager)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community) instance (local or cloud)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd api
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Set up environment variables:**
    Create a `.env` file in the root directory by copying the template:
    ```bash
    cp .env.template .env
    ```
    Then, fill in the required values in the `.env` file. See the [Environment Variables](#-environment-variables) section for more details.

### Usage

-   **Development Mode:**
    This command compiles the TypeScript code and starts the server with `nodemon`, which will automatically restart on file changes.
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

-   **Production Mode:**
    This command compiles the TypeScript code and starts the server using the compiled JavaScript files.
    ```bash
    npm run start
    ```
    For managing the application in a production environment, you can use PM2:
    ```bash
    npm run prod
    ```

-   **Build:**
    To only compile the TypeScript code, run:
    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```

## üìñ API Documentation

The API routes are defined in the `/routes` directory. The API is segmented by user roles.

-   **`auth.router.ts`**: Handles user registration, login, and logout.
-   **`user.router.ts`**: Contains endpoints for general users, such as browsing courses, purchasing, and managing their profile.
-   **`tutor.router.ts`**: Contains endpoints for tutors to manage their courses, content, and view statistics.
-   **`admin.router.ts`**: Contains endpoints for administrators to manage users, categories, banners, and view platform-wide stats.

## üìÅ Folder Structure

The project follows a feature-based architecture, separating concerns for better maintainability and scalability.

## üõ†Ô∏è Reusable Utilities (`utils/`)

The `/utils` directory contains helper functions that can be reused across the application.

-   **`cropper.ts`**: Contains functions for processing and cropping images using `sharp`.
-   **`error.ts`**: Exports a custom `ErrorHandler` class for consistent error handling.
-   **`mailer.ts`**: A utility for sending emails using `nodemailer`.
-   **`parser.ts`**: Helper functions for parsing data, if any.
-   **`pdf.ts`**: A utility for generating PDF documents from HTML, likely using `puppeteer`.
-   **`reportGenerator.ts`**: A high-level utility that orchestrates the creation of admin and tutor reports, using the `pdf.ts` and `excel4node` utilities.
